## Project Summary

Oftentimes in our daily, busy lives, we encounter a variety of medical symptoms that make us feel unwell. In these times we are often too busy to go see a doctor, and sometimes, even reading through multiple web articles may feel too time consuming as well. Our project aims to deliver a web app where users can quickly find solutions for their medical needs. Users can input the symptoms they are experiencing and our web app would output potential conditions (illnesses, diseases, etc.) they may be experiencing as well as treatments for the conditions. This would help reduce the time users would need in finding answers based on their medical symptoms as they would need to read through multiple web pages if they were to perform a simple "Google-search" and skim through several articles.
Users would input data on their symptoms by typing in their symptoms into a type-bar, and their search inputs would be pattern-matched with what data we have. The output would be text based information but would be supported with additional design aspects such that the web app has an appealing UI. This is all done after the user has made an account and has logged in. This way, their most recent search and results would be saved, saving time for them by reviewing what results they had received previously.
